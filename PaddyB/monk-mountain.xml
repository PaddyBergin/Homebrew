			<p>The mountain is a sturdy landmark of the world. Intimidating and unyielding, the mountain endures all aspects of nature. The way of the mountains eye is a discipline that embodies the spirit of the mountain and harnesses the power of observation.</p> 
			<p>Mountain Monks train themselves to identify the weaknesses of their enemies through observation of their physiological history. A broken bone that never fully healed, a scar inflicted by a terrifying opponent, a wound received during a devastating battle, these are the things that a mountain Monk sees in their opponents and knows how to target. </p>
